3. ## About me:
   * Hello, I'm Mateusz. I'm a self-taught man in programming. Trying to learn languages, working at the same time.
     I would like to work as a programmer in the future so I'm trying to get this goal done.
     I'm a really nice man with big sense of humor, love joking, have fun. However at work always trying to do my best, help people, im open to everyone. I'm learning very fast, for example I had 1 month only to learn the basics of JS preparing to this course and I think I'm doing well.
   * I started to learn HTML5/CSS3 1,5 years ago, cause I wanted to learn PHP. After 1 year of learnig PHP (with some
     brakes) I stopped cause of personal problems. During this time I've learned Git, mySQL database. Unfortunately I didn't work for any company yet, so don't have any practical experience.
4. ## Skills:
   * HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript, mySQL database
5. ## Code examples: Code only during courses at eduweb.pl or udemi.
6. ## Education: online learning only
   * Git
   * PHP
